Welcome to _Gradus Reason_. This site is a place to learn the Reason OCaml language.

The name _Gradus_ is a reference to ancient language textbooks such as 
[_Gradus ad Parnassum_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradus_ad_Parnassum), which were used 
by early scholars to learn Latin and Greek. The title meant 
"Steps to Parnassus," a mountain range in Greece that was symbolically important for 
the arts and creative activity.

The posts here aim to be instructive and contain plenty of examples that mark the 
steps of one learning the language.
